<a href="./findSum.js" target="_blank"> Find Sum </a>: - sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5

<a href="./movingZerototheEnd.js" target="_blank">Moving zero to the end</a>: - Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

<a href="./textStrips.js" target="_blank">Text strips</a>: - Complete the solution so that it strips all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out.

<a href="./meanSquare.js" target="_blank">Mean square</a>: - Complete the function that - accepts two integer arrays of equal length. compares the value each member in one array to the corresponding member in the other. squares the absolute value difference between those two values and returns the average of those squared absolute value difference between each member pair.

<a href="./matrixDeterminant.js" target="_blank">Matrix determinant</a>: - Write a function that accepts a square matrix (N x N 2D array) and returns the determinant of the matrix.

<a href="./validParantheses.js" target="_blank">Valid parenthesis</a>: - Write a function that takes a string of parentheses, and determines if the order of the parentheses is valid. The function should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.

<a href="./pigLatin.js" target="_blank">Pig latin</a>: - Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word. Leave punctuation marks untouched.

<a href="./stringToInteger.js" target="_blank">String to integer</a>: - In this kata we want to convert a string into an integer. The strings simply represent the numbers in words.

    - Examples:

        "one" => 1
        "twenty" => 20
        "two hundred forty-six" => 246
        "seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen" => 783919
        Additional Notes:

        The minimum number is "zero" (inclusively)
        The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)
        The "and" in e.g. "one hundred and twenty-four" is optional, in some cases it's present and in others it's not
        All tested numbers are valid, you don't need to validate them

<a href="./closeMultiple10.js" target="_blank">Close multiple 10</a> : - Return the closest number multiple of 10

<a href="./findFirstUnique.js" target="_blank">Find first unique</a>: Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index.
If it does not exist, return -1.

<a href="./findOdd.js" target="_blank">Find odd</a>:
Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Examples
[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).

<a href="./panic.js" target="_blank">Panic</a>:
Write a PANIC! function. The function should take in a sentence and return the same
sentence in all caps with an exclamation point (!) at the end. Use JavaScript's
built in string methods.

If the string is a phrase or sentence, add a ðŸ˜± emoji in between each word.

Example input: "Hello"
Example output: "HELLO!"

Example input: "I'm almost out of coffee"
Example output: "I'M ðŸ˜± ALMOST ðŸ˜± OUT ðŸ˜± OF ðŸ˜± COFFEE!"

<a href="./removeElement.js" target="_blank">Remove Elements</a>:
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

<a href="./staircase.js" target="_blank">Staircase</a>:
Staircase detail

This is a staircase of size n:

#

##

###

####

Its base and height are both equal to . It is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

Write a program that prints a staircase of size n.
